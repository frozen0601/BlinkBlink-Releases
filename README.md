### Desktop App for Eye Health and Productivity Breaks

**BlinkBlink** is a desktop app designed to help you follow the [**20-20-20 rule**](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#definition), encouraging regular breaks to protect your eyes and boost productivity. After dealing with dry eyes and eye strain for what felt like forever, I finally created **BlinkBlink** to help myself and others avoid the same discomfort. It runs seamlessly in the background with a simple, clean interface, making it effortless to maintain healthy screen habits.

## More to Come

BlinkBlink believes in focusing on what truly matters, so every detail is thoughtfully designed with your well-being in mind. With that philosophy guiding us, here are a few exciting features on our roadmap:

- **Winky's Gentle Reminder**: Prefer a less intrusive interface than a full-screen overlay? No worries! Winky<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030cfe98-dff7-4088-89f7-e81259a5bfdc" width="32">, our cute monster, will warmly remind you from the corner of your screen to take a break and protect your eyes. How cute is that!

- **Work Period Settings**: During work, when your eyes are burning from hours of screen time, you‚Äôre grateful that BlinkBlink has your back. But after work, BlinkBlink can feel like an annoying reminder when all you want is to Netflix and chill without thinking about eye protection. No problem! Just set your work hours, and BlinkBlink will only protect your eyes while you‚Äôre working.

- **Sound/Alert Options**: Let you choose between a subtle sound, vibration, or visual cue for the reminder, depending on your preference.

And more constant polishing. The devil‚Äôs in the details!
