### Desktop App for Eye Health and Productivity Breaks

**BlinkBlink** is a desktop app designed to help you follow the [**20-20-20 rule**](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#definition), encouraging regular breaks to protect your eyes and boost productivity. After dealing with dry eyes and eye strain for what felt like forever, I finally created **BlinkBlink** to help myself and others avoid the same discomfort. It runs seamlessly in the background with a simple, clean interface, making it effortless to maintain healthy screen habits.
